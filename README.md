# Overview

Once again this gives me more of an idea of future game development, and inventory management.

I used C++, in visual studio code, also had to install developer command prompt.

Like I said above, I want to do as a hobby is create my own game some day, and this gives me more ideas of all what goes into it.

# Future Work

- I like to add a adventure function, to introduce a way for the player to get items to come back to town to sell stuff for more money.
- Add in more shops, adding a lot more itesm to shop, as well as seasonal items.
- with items, giving them more of a description, and uses for them, that will affect adventures and etc.
